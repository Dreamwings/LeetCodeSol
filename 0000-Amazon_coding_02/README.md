Given an array of days, days[i] is the number of events on the i-th day (i starts from 0). 
Participating the j-th event (j starts from 0), you'll get (j + 1) points. You can attend 
at most k consecutive events for any consecutive days. 


Write a Python program to get the maximum points giving the array days and the integer k 
(0 < k <= sum(days)).


Note that days is can be regarded as cyclic in nature. When the last day reached, you 
start from the first day again.
