Find Minimum Pair Sum
Given two arrays A[] and B[] of size N each, the task is
to minimize A[i] + B[j] such that j â‰¥ i. Assume A and B
have the same length.

Examples:

Input: A[] = {34, 12, 45, 10, 86, 39, 77},
       B[] = {5, 42, 29, 63, 30, 33, 20}
Output: 30
Explanation: For minimizing the sum, take i = 3 and j = 6.

Input: A[] = {34, 17, 45, 10, 19},
       B[] = {2, 13, 7, 11, 16}
Output: 21
Explanation: For minimizing the sum, take both i and j = 3.
